# ⚛️ ReactFacts — What I Learned

This project is part of **Section 1: Static Pages** from my React learning journey. I built a simple static site called **ReactFacts**, which helped me understand the foundational concepts of React including components, JSX, and styling.

## ✨ What I Learned

### 📘 Introduction to React  
This was my first hands-on experience with React. I learned how it differs from regular HTML/CSS/JS workflows and why it’s such a powerful library for building UI.

### ⚙️ Why React?  
I discovered React’s **composable** and **declarative** nature — how we can build UIs by combining small, reusable pieces (components), and how React handles the UI updates for us based on data.

### 🧱 React Elements & JSX  
I learned how React uses JavaScript to create HTML-like elements using JSX. I got comfortable with the syntax and even practiced writing JSX expressions within return statements.

### 🧩 Creating Custom Components  
I built my own functional components like `Header` and `MainContent`, then combined them to render a full static page. This helped me understand how component-based architecture works in React.

### 🧼 Fragments  
I also learned about `React.Fragment` and shorthand `<>...</>` syntax to avoid unnecessary HTML wrappers, which helped keep my DOM clean and semantic.

### 🎨 Styling with Classes  
Although this wasn’t focused on CSS frameworks, I practiced applying CSS classes to JSX elements and learned how to keep styling organized in React apps.
